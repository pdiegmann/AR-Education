\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Bridging the gap between virtual and real worlds, Augmented Reality (AR) provides new possibilities of teaching and learning which have been increasingly recognized by educational reaserchers. \autocite [cf.][41]{Wu.2013} Although AR is one of the most emerging technologies in education in these days \autocite [cf.]{Johnson.2010}, the value of Augmented Reality applications in educational environments remains unclear in many cases[Zitat]. In addition, there are different types of augmented reality applications in educational environments which may differ regarding their benefits towards educational outcomes[Five Directions Zitat]. This leads to the problem that teachers and professor may be not aware of potential benefits of augmented reality applications in comparison to conventional learning tools.[Zitat suchen]\\
Forschungsfrage: Which Benefits are provided by an AR application in comparison to conventional learning tools? \\
Forschungsproblem: A first approach to consolidate AR Benefits in educational environments has been made. Unfortunately, the approach by Radu can not be replicated because of missing information towards the regarded databases and include / exclude criteria. In addition this approach does not consider the different types of AR applications in educational environments and we think that there might be additional benefits which are not mentioned by Radu.\\
Relevanz: An overview of the benefits of AR in educational environments regarding the different types of AR applications can help teachers and professors to decide whether the implementation of AR is reasonable in certain educational scenarios.\\
Forschungsantwort: Overview of the Benefits of AR in educational environments and mapping of different types of AR applications and AR Benefits.
