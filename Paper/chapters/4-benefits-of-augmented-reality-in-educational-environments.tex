\subsubsection{Learning Type}
This subsection deals with benefits we clustered as 'Learning Type'. This group contains benefits which could be linked to a specific type of learning, for instance creativity or a more theoretical learning approach like language education. \\
Therefor this group contains two subitems: improved learning curve and improved creativity. While an improved learning curve is observable on skills based learning, such as spatial skills, or on fields which require a logical understanding, such as languages, improved creativity can be observed on less theoretical grounded areas, such as problem solving or arts.
