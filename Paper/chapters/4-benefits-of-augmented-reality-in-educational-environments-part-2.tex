\subsection{Mapping of the Benefits to the „Five Directions“}
\label{subsec:Mapping}
Following, we will present the mapping of the found benefits to the five directions. In \ref{tab:MapBenefitsDirections} the mapping results are listed in detail. 
\subsubsection{Discovery-based Learning}
We found eight articles whose presented learning concepts were Discovery-based. Those articles had the most mentions of State of Mind benefits, especially increased motivation. 47\% of all increased motivation benefits were related to a Discovery-based Augmented Reality application. Also, an improved learning curve were mentioned. About one-third of all improved learning curves were observed in Discovery-based Learning environments.
\subsubsection{Objects Modelling}
In our result set of 25 articles, we found five which dealt with an Objects Modelling approach for the presented Augmented Reality application. Similar to Discovery-based Learning applications, Objects Modelling resulted in an increased motivation and satisfaction. We found about 27\% of all mentions of increased motivation in an Objects Modelling context. Also, an improved learning curve was observed. About 22\% of all mentions of an improved learning curve were coherence with an Objects Modelling application.\subsubsection{AR Books}\subsubsection{Skills Training}\subsubsection{AR Gaming}
