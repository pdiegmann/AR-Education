\subsection{Mapping of the Benefits to the „Five Directions“}
\label{subsec:Mapping}
Following, we will present the mapping of the found benefits to the five directions. In \ref{tab:MapBenefitsDirections} the mapping results are listed in detail. 

\subsubsection{\DBLns}
We found eight articles (about 32\% of all articles in our result set) whose presented learning concepts were Discovery-based. Those articles had the most mentions of State of Mind benefits, especially increased motivation. 47\% of all increased motivation benefits were related to a Discovery-based \AR application. Also, an improved learning curve were mentioned. About one-third of all improved learning curves were observed in \DBL environments.

\subsubsection{\OMns}
In our result set of 25 articles, we found five articles, which dealt with an \OM approach for the presented \AR application. Similar to \DBL applications, \OM resulted in an increased motivation and satisfaction. We found about 27\% of all mentions of increased motivation in an \OM context. Also, an improved learning curve was observed. About 22\% of all mentions of an improved learning curve were coherence with an \OM application.

\subsubsection{\ARBns}
Two articles (which makes a total of eight percent) were found which were based on an \ARB application. \ARB applications were the least found in the articles. \ARB applications are also connected to an increase in motivation, but not as much as \DBL or \OM.
\subsubsection{\STns}
We found seven articles (about 28 \& of all articles) which presented a \ST \AR application.

\subsubsection{\ARGns}
\ARG was presented in three articles of our result set which accounts for 12 \%.
